You are hired by a company Gem Stones co ltd, which is a cubic zirconia manufacturer. You are provided with the dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 27,000 cubic zirconia (which is an inexpensive diamond alternative with many of the same qualities as a diamond). The company is earning different profits on different prize slots. You have to help the company in predicting the price for the stone on the bases of the details given in the dataset so it can distinguish between higher profitable stones and lower profitable stones so as to have better profit share. Also, provide them with the best 5 attributes that are most important.
